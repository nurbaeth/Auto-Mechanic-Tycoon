## ⚙️ Smart Contract     
       
The game is written in Solidity. It uses:      
- Daily repair limits (resets every 24h)       
- On-chain reputation tracking          
- Stateless repair system (no NFTs or tokens required)       
          
```solidity        
function repairCar() external onlyRegistered {     
    ...     
    reputation += 10;   
}
